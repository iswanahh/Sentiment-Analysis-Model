# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files in this repository result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews.

In this project, I used Amazon SageMaker to build a sentiment analysis model. The goal of this project is to utilize a simple web app to collect a user's moview review. The web app then sends the review to the deployed model to predict the sentiment of the movie and returns an output. The output could be positive or negative depending on the sentiment of the movie being reviewed.
